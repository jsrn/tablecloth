# common.css

Common.css is a set of style rules (built on top of normalize.css) to unify the common functionality that I find myself implementing from project to project.

Comments, feedback and pull requests are more than welcomed.

## Demo

You can see the sheets in action [here](http://jsrn.net/commoncss/).

## Usage

To use in your page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/normalize.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/common.css">
```

To build:
```bash
rake sass
```
