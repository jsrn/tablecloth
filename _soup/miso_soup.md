## Ingredients

- 1 cup water
- 1/4 tsp dashi stock
- 3/4 tsp wakame (washed)
- 1 tsp miso


## Method

1. Add the wakame to some water to re-hydrate
2. Add the dashi stock to the water and bring to a boil
3. Add the rinsed wakame and boil for 2 minutes
4. Take off the heat, very gradually mix in the miso (bring a little stock into the spoon and stir)


## Notes

- If the miso paste has small chunks of rice in, you can expect these to stick around. It doesn't mean your miso paste hasn't dissolved properly.
- If it's too salty, you probably used too much dashi stock. Add some water.
