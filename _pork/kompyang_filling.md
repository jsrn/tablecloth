## Ingredients

- 4 (smashed) garlic cloves
- 1kg belly pork
- 1-2 tsp sugar per 500g pork

## Method

Notes hastily taken during a phone call, which consequently are almost useless:

take belly pork (clean, but whole), put in pot and boil and when the blood comes out, throw away all the water and blood and fat

put garlic, light/dark soy sauce, water, sugar, 1 spoon sing tao jio????

par boil egg

take meat out when cooked and boil sauce down until it's nice and thick or use corn starch to thicken

2-3 5 star anise

no ginger, no onion, just garlic and star anise

optional: katsup manis instead of dark sauce
