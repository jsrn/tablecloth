name: Orange glazed ham (T.L.)
---

## Ingredients

- Medium to large shoulder ham (bone in)
- 1½ cups (375ml) fresh orange juice
- ½ cup (125ml) fresh lime juice
- 1 cup (220g) brown sugar
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger (one thumb)
- 12 cloves (for poking into oranges)
- 3 star anise
- 2 tsp light soy sauce
- 4 oranges, peeled, cut into 5mm slices
- Whole cloves (pick the ones with the longer stems)

## Method

1. Stir the juices and sugar in a  saucepan over a medium- low heat for 2 min.  Add the cinnamon stick, ginger and 3 star anise.  Simmer for 30 min till lightly thickened.  Cool for 1-2 hours.  Stir in the soy sauce.
2. Use a small sharp knife to remove the rind from the ham leaving about 6-7 cm of the portion closest to the joint.
3. Preheat to 180C.  Place ham in a roasting tray.  Brush ¼ cup of glaze over the ham and bake for 15 min.  Remove from oven.  4. Cover the rind covered portion with a piece of aluminium foil to prevent burning.
5. Arrange the orange slices, overlapping, on top of the ham.  Secure each slice with a clove.  Gently brush glaze over the top.  Place the star anise on top of oranges.  Bake for 1 hour and 15 min, brushing ham with the marinade every 15 min (about 5 times).
6. Strain the juice and serve the ham.

(Optional – Add a can of sliced pineapple to the juices and bake in the last 15 min.  Serve ham.)
