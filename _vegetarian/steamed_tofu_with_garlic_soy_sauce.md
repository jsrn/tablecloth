## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp. light soy sauce , I use low sodium
- 1 tbsp. oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp. sesame oil
- 1 tbsp. dried small shrimp or roasted peanuts
- 1 tbsp. chopped scallion and coriander or scallion only

- 1/2 tsp. sugar
- 1/2 tbsp. black vinegar
- 2 garlic cloves

## Method

1. Place the tofu in a large plate and then cut the cubes into several 2 cm thick pieces. Silken tofu can be broken very easily, cutting in serving plate can avoid transferring and keep the original shape. You can also choose to steam tofu as a whole box shape. But cutting makes the dish more delicious.
2. Let the tofu stay in the plate for coupe of minutes, then carefully discard the water released.
3. Set up your steamer and steam the tofu for 6-8 minutes. Transfer out and discard only water in the plate.
4. Heat oil in a small pot and then drizzle the hot oil on garlic and scallion. Then mix in all the other sauces.
5. Drizzle the sauce over the steamed tofu and serve the dish hot.
