## Ingredients

- 2 medium aubergines
- 40ml extra virgin olive oil
- 1/4 tsp ground coriander
- 1/4 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tbsp tahini
- 1 large lemon, juiced
- 1/2 small bunch parsley, finely chopped
- flatbreads or pitta bread, to serve


## Method

1. Blister the aubergines on the hob until soft, with the skin blackened and blistered all over. The skin should be coming off in flakes.
2. Peel off and discard the vast majority of the skin. Whatever's left will contribute to the lovely smokey flavour.
3. Add them to a blender, along with:
  - 30ml of the oil
  - The coriander, cumin, tahini and lemon
  - Half of the parsley
  - Salt & pepper
4. Pulse until baba ganoush.
5. Add to a bowl and drizzle over the remaining 10ml of olive oil.
6. Garnish with the remaining parsley.
